Comprehensive Insights into Global Mineral Commodities: Analysis, Visualization and Intelligent Assistance

Website: https://mineral-ai.net

With the growing emphasis on sustainability, criticality, and availability in materials research, our study introduces a comprehensive data analytics platform to provide country-specific insights into global elemental production and reserves. Utilizing data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), our web application incorporates quantitative measures of market concentration such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to identify potential risks and opportunities related to resource availability. The platform features an AI assistant powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, leveraging the past ten years of USGS mineral commodities summaries. This system employs an open-source large language model (LLM) to enable users to query various aspects of raw materials, including reserves, production, market share, usage, price, substitutes, recycling, and more. By retrieving relevant documents and generating accurate, comprehensive responses, our tool addresses a crucial gap in publicly available resources, offering a unified application for detailed material analysis. This platform provides valuable support for material scientists in assessing sustainability, criticality, and market risks, thereby aiding in the development of new materials. 

To run the program locally, insert the Hugging Face Hub access token into the 'LLMResponse.py' file, and then execute the 'app.py' file.
