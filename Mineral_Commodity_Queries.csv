"What are the Events, Trends, and Issues associated with Lithium in 2023?",mcs2024-lithium.pdf,"Events, Trends, and Issues: Excluding U.S. production, worldwide lithium production in 2023 increased by 23% to approximately 180,000 tons from 146,000 tons in 2022 in response to strong demand from the lithium-ion battery market. Global consumption of lithium in 2023 was estimated to be 180,000 tons, a 27% increase from the revised consumption figure of 142,000 tons in 2022. However, concern of a short-term lithium oversupply, expiration of the Chinese Government’s decade-long program of subsidies for electric vehicle (EV) purchases, and weaker-than- expected EV sales worldwide caused the price of lithium to decrease considerably in 2023.
Spot lithium carbonate prices in China [cost, insurance, and freight (c.i.f.)] decreased from approximately $76,000 per ton in January to about $23,000 per ton in November. For fixed contracts, the annual average U.S. lithium carbonate price was $46,000 per ton in 2023, a decrease of 32% from that in 2022. Spot lithium hydroxide prices in China
(c.i.f. China) decreased from approximately $81,500 per ton in January to about $22,500 per ton in November. Spodumene (6% lithium oxide) prices in Australia (free on board) decreased from approximately $6,000 per ton in January to about $2,500 per ton in November.
Seven mineral operations in Australia, one mineral tailings operation in Brazil, two brine operations each in Argentina and Chile, two mineral operations in Canada, five mineral and four brine operations in China, and one mineral operation in Zimbabwe accounted for the majority of world lithium production. Additionally, smaller operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Portugal, the United States, and Zimbabwe also contributed to world lithium production. Owing to the rapid increase in demand of lithium in 2023, established lithium operations worldwide increased or were in the process of increasing production capacity.
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy selected 12 lithium-based projects funded with $1.6 billion from the 2022 U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support new commercial-scale domestic facilities to extract and process lithium, manufacture battery components, recycle batteries, and develop new technologies to increase U.S. lithium reserves. The 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act added tax incentives to consolidate sourcing of battery materials and manufacturing of EVs to North American and U.S.-partner countries.
Lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies in Asia, Europe, and North America. Strategic alliances and joint ventures among technology companies and exploration companies continued to be established to ensure a reliable, diversified supply of lithium for battery suppliers and vehicle manufacturers. Brine-based lithium sources were in various stages of development or exploration in Argentina, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, China, and the United States; mineral-based lithium sources were in various stages of development or exploration in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Congo (Kinshasa), Czechia, Ethiopia, France, Finland, Germany, Ghana, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Rwanda, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, and Zimbabwe; lithium-clay sources were in various stages of development or exploration in Mexico and the United States.","Key Events, Trends, and Issues associated with Lithium in 2023:

Global Lithium Production: Worldwide lithium production in 2023 increased by 23% to approximately 180,000 tons from 146,000 tons in 2022 in response to strong demand from the lithium-ion battery market.
Global Lithium Consumption: Global consumption of lithium in 2023 was estimated to be 180,000 tons, a 27% increase from the revised consumption figure of 142,000 tons in 2022.

Recycling: Construction of lithium battery recycling plants increased at a rapid pace, with about 40 companies in Canada and the United States and 50 companies in Europe recycled lithium batteries or planned to do so.
Import Sources: Argentina, Chile, China, Russia, and other countries continued to be the main import sources for the United States, with Argentina accounting for 51% of imports, Chile for 43%, and China for 3%.
Government Stockpile: There is no information available on the government stockpile of lithium.
Potential Disposals: There were no potential disposals listed for any of the materials across both fiscal years.

Exports: The exports of Lithium from the United States decreased to 2,300 metric tons in 2023, down from 2,440 metric tons in 2022. The decrease in exports was likely due to the increase in imports and the decrease in domestic consumption.

Price: The price of battery-grade Lithium carbonate in the United States decreased to $46,000 per metric ton in 2023, down from $68,100 per metric ton in 2022. This decrease was likely due to the increase in global supply and the decrease in demand.

Employment: The employment number in the Lithium mining and milling industry in the United States remained constant at 70 from 2019 to 2023.

Net Import Reliance: The net import reliance of the United States as a percentage of apparent consumption was greater than 25% for all years from 2019 to 2023, indicating that the country relies heavily on imports to meet its Lithium demand.
